## Python/Windows

1. git bash
  (see if it opens)

3. VS Code
  `code`
  (see if opens. If not:)
  `code --version` to see if it is installed
4. Anaconda
  `conda --version`
  `python --version`
  (As long as it is python 3, I'm not too worried about versions)
5. Jupyter Notebook
  `jupyter notebook`
  (see if opens)
  If the browser opens, but fails to load, change default browser to another and try it again
6. nltk
  Either in python shell or jupyter notebook:
  `import nltk`
  `nltk.download()`
  `from nltk.book import *`
  If library not working, try to open from the anaconda navigator

  Open it and check version
  Needs to be 3.10

  If it is installed, but doesn't launch from terminal:
  `Command` + `Shift` + `p`, type `shell` and select `Shell Command : Install code in PATH`
  Close your terminal, open it and try it again
