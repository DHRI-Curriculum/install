## Test Install

1. Navigate to your applications and click on QGIS.

2. You will likely receive an error that says ““QGIS” can’t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software.”

3. To troubleshoot this, go back to your applications and this time instead of double-clicking on the QGIS app, right-click and select “Open.” Then when prompted again, select “Open.”

4. Note that after this point you will be able to open the app by simply double-clicking on it.
