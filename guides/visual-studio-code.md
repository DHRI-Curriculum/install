## What it is

Visual Studio Code is a text editor that allows us to write code in a variety of computational languages such as python, HTML, javascript, among others.

## Why we use it

For the Digital Humanities Research Institute, we use Visual Studio Code because it supports [syntax highlighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting), it is free and built on open source, and it is consistent across Mac, Windows, and Linux systems.
