# Firefox

## What it is

[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/exp/firefox/) is a free to download web browser built by the [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/about/), a non profit organization. Firefox allows users to access websites on the internet. 

## Why we use it

For the Digital Humanities Research Institute, we use Firefox because it works on Windows and Mac operating systems, it is frequently updated, and it values user privacy. 

## Installation instructions: macOS Catalina

<Insert optional introductory paragraph here, where you have the option of describing other operating systems that your instructions likely work for (perhaps other versions of macOS) and also linking out to good troubleshooting websites.>

### Step 1: <Insert Step 1 Header>

<Each instruction step should follow this convention. A step should contain no more than one or two clicks/dragging files, or entering information into text boxes, unless there is, for example, a form where you may need to input multiple points of information in the same place.>

<Include a screenshot for each step - see below for example of how to insert it. If there are more complicated things to do, consider making a GIF.>
